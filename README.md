## What is Puppy Love?
Puppy Love is a fast and easy way to find a new buddy for Man's Best Friend.
Just fill out 10 simple questions on your dog's personality and social habits, and Puppy Love will check them against every dog in our database to find your best match.

The project is still in beta, in the future I would like to add a secure way for matches to contact each other to set up a playdate with their dogs. I'd also like to include email notifications and set up individual user accounts using google authentication or okta.
